# Repairing: merchants' repairs and the Pip-Boy's

The game repairs weapons and armour two ways: a merchant's repair
services (`ShowRepairMenu` in ten dialogue lines of the official master:
Raul, Samuel at the 188, Mick in Freeside, Old Lady Gibson, Calamity,
Major Knight, Dale Barton, Sato, and one on the player), and the Pip-Boy's
Repair button on ITEMS, which mends an item with another. Until 2026-10-06
nv-rs had neither.

## Read from `FalloutNV.exe` 1.4.0.525

Settings (exe default → the master's): `fRepairMax` 2, `fRepairMin` 0.5,
`fRepairScavengeMult` 0.05, `fRepairSkillBase` 4, `fRepairSkillMax` 9 → 10,
`fItemRepairCostMult` 1 → 2.

### Merchants

- Their Repair, s, is read as the menus read skills (`0066ef20`): the
  current value within 0..100, truncated. A person's skill is their record's
  value plus its offset (`DNAM`: 14 skills, then 14 offsets) unless the
  game works their stats out (`ACBS` 0x10): Mick's is 15 + 60 = 75.
- They mend to t = (`fRepairSkillBase` + (`fRepairSkillMax` −
  `fRepairSkillBase`) × s / 100) / 10, at most 1, of an item's full health
  (`007b7f70`): Mick to 85%.
- The cost (`00648230`): `fItemRepairCostMult` × value × (t × 10 −
  condition% / 10) / 10, rounded (halves up) and at least 1 when above
  0.5; otherwise nothing, and the line can't be repaired. Mick mending a 9mm
  pistol (value 100) at 30%: 2 × 100 × (8.5 − 3) / 10 = 110 caps. No
  Barter adjustment.
- The list (`007b7b40`): the player's weapons and armour with health; not
  caps, quest items or armour marked not playable; below `fRepairSkillMax`
  × 10 percent (100); armour only with a damage threshold or resistance.
  Each line (`007b7920`): its cost; bright (alpha 255, `_CanRepair`) when it
  costs something the player can pay, else 128; the meter condition × 0.6
  wide; the worn mark. Order (`007b7c40`): what can be paid for first; then
  the most health first, worn first on a tie; among those that can't be,
  the reverse.
- The labels: "`sRepairSkill`   s", "`sInventoryCaps`   n" ("n+" past
  `iCapsLimit`), Repair All "`sRepairAllItems`" with every line's cost,
  usable when that's above 0 and the player can pay it.
- The pointer on a line (`007b82f0`): the item's picture, its condition and
  figure (a weapon's damage, rounded; armour's DT, else DR, at its
  condition, truncated, `00646d40`: × (0.5 + c) at or below half); when t
  is above the condition (both rounded to thousandths) the repaired figures,
  "+n%" and "+n" (the differences, at least 0, rounded), "`sRepairCost`"
  bright when it can be paid; else "`sCantRepairPastMax`" with t in percent.
- A click (`007b7d80`): a line that can be paid for is mended and paid
  (`UIRepairWeapon`), the list filled again; one that can't,
  `UIVATSInsufficientAP`. Repair All mends every line that can be paid for
  and pays the total. The caps go to the vendor.

### The Pip-Boy

- The new condition (`00648090`, `007b57f0`, `007b5d80`): with a and b the
  two items' conditions in percent / 10, hi and lo the larger and smaller,
  min(1, (hi + `fRepairMin` + (`fRepairMax` − `fRepairMin`) × Repair / 100 +
  lo × `fRepairScavengeMult`) / 10). Repair doesn't cap it: the function
  works out the skill cap and never uses it, and its "skill needed" (only
  when the result is no better than hi, which `fRepairMin` 0.5 rules out)
  never shows.
- What mends an item (`0047bb50`): another of it, or something on its
  repair list (`REPL`); with Jury Rigging (perk entry point 48 "Has Jury
  Rigging"), for an item that has a repair list, anything of the same kind
  that isn't a quest item: weapons playable with the same skill and
  animation type, armour playable with the same weight class and equip
  type.
- ITEMS offers Repair (`00781860`) for a weapon or armour below 100%
  (rounded up) when the player has another of it, or something else that
  mends it that isn't worn.
- The list (`007b6aa0`): every one of each thing that mends it, each its own
  line, the chosen one first and marked; of the chosen kind a worn one
  isn't offered.
- Mending (`007b5d80`, `007b5b40`): the chosen item's new condition, one of
  the other gone, "Items Repaired" counted, `UIRepairWeapon`; the menu
  closes when the condition reaches 99% or nothing's left to use.

### Armour wearing (what there is to repair)

- A hit's `fArmorDamage` (Xbox PDB `HitData` +40; `009b5a30`), when the
  hit does no fatigue damage: `fDamageToArmorPercentage` (0.5) × the damage
  × the target's resistance share (DR, at most 100, / 100; a companion's ×
  (1 + 0.05 × the player's Charisma); the ammunition's DR effects; at most
  `fMaxArmorRating` / 100), plus, after the threshold, the ammunition's
  damage effects and perk entry 0, 0.5 × min(the threshold, the damage
  left − the 20% floor). The game's armour has DR 0 (leather armour,
  reinforced: DT 10, DR 0), so it's the threshold's part that wears it.
- `0089a760`: above 0, on the player only (the actor's slot 0x360, true
  for `PlayerCharacter` alone), a hit on the head (part type 1 or 2)
  wears what's worn on the head (biped slot 0), else the hair slot's;
  any other hit the upper body's (`0089d8b0`); through `DamageItem`
  (`00891360`): perk entry 68, the health less it, below 1 nothing left;
  the player told when it drops below 25% (`sArmorLowCond`, weapons
  `sWeaponLowCond`, with `WPNBreak`).
- A weapon with nothing left breaks (`00891360` at 0): the player's is
  taken off (`0088d7d0`) with `sWeaponBreak` and `WPNBreak`; someone
  else's is dropped (the actor's slot 0x3cc) unless it can't be dropped
  (`DNAM` flags 0x08), is embedded (0x20) or a quest item. Armour at 0
  stays on.
- Equipping (`0088c830`): a weapon or armour with no health (worn out, or
  none at full: the master's eight "Broken …" / "Jammed Minigun" props) is
  refused, the player told `sCantEquipBrokenItem`.
- What armour gives (`008d2110` DT, `008d22b0` DR, each piece once): its
  figure at its condition, `004be0b0` / `004bdf90`: the record's value
  truncated × (1 above half, 0.5 + condition at or below, `00646d40`),
  rounded up; DR's sum at most `fMaxArmorRating`.

## Here

`world::repair` has the rules: `skill`, `mended` / `mended_condition`,
`service_target`, `service_cost`, `service_lists`, `service_lines` (the
list in the menu's order), `repair_by` and `pay`, `mends`, `can_repair`,
`parts`, `repair_with`, `shown_stat`. `ShowRepairMenu` raises
`Event::RepairServices(vendor)`; the viewer opens
`ui::menus::repair_services` (`game_menus::repair`), which asks the world
to repair and refills.

The Pip-Boy: ITEMS' Repair button (R) is usable on an item
`world::repair::can_repair` allows (`ItemLine::repairable`); pressing it
asks the game (`Action::OpenRepair`) for the screen's lines
(`ui::pipboy::gather::repair_input`) and opens `ui::pipboy::repair` over
ITEMS, drawn on the Pip-Boy's screen; Enter on a line asks for the repair
(`Action::Repair`: `world::repair::repair_with`), then the screen is filled
again or closes; E goes back to ITEMS.

The screen takes the mouse as the game's `RepairMenu` does (its `DoEnter`
`007b6120`, `DoLeave` `007b6a00` and `DoClick` `007b5b40`, vtable
`01075c5c` slots 0x10, 0x14, 0x0c; its wheel slot is the base menu's, so
the wheel only moves the list's scroll bar): the pointer onto a line makes
it the list's choice and shows what mending with it does; off it, the
repaired card (9) and "choose an item" (8) hide and nothing is chosen; a
click mends with the chosen line when the line's text is at full alpha,
it isn't the item itself and the repaired card shows; a click on Cancel
goes back to ITEMS. Keys go the same way (Enter clicks the chosen line).
Without a pad nothing is chosen as it opens (`004b71d0`: the first line
only with one). Each `DoEnter` turns the Pip-Boy's scroll knob a notch
with `UIPipBoyScroll` when the chosen line's `listindex` isn't the one it
last turned for (`011da7d8`, kept between openings). After a repair the
used line goes and the choice moves to the line after it, or the one
before when it was the last (`0071a5c0` → `0071aaa0`); at 99% or with only
the item left it closes as Cancel does, with `UIMenuMode`. The brackets
sit on the item's line by operators (`007b6aa0`: the height the line's
less 1, the y the line's; there is no animation). `ui::pipboy::Pipboy`
hands the pointer to the screen (`Code`) while it's up; the viewer's
`--menu-pointer` / `--menu-click` drive the Pip-Boy's pointer too. Seen in
the viewer in Doc Mitchell's house with three 9mm pistols at 30% (`--run
"player.AddItemHealthPercent WeapNV9mmPistol 3 0.3" --pipboy items:0
--pipboy-keys r --menu-pointer 760,348 --menu-click 25,35,45`): the
pointer on the third line chose it ("+9%", DAM 6 → 7), a click mended
the pistol with it (30% → 39%) and two lines were left.

Checks: `crates/world/tests/repair.rs` (the formulas, a merchant's list and
order, a repair paid to the vendor, the Pip-Boy's rules with a repair list
and Jury Rigging), `world::repair::tests` (an NPC's skill offset),
`ui::menus::repair_services::tests` (filling, the pointer's stats, clicks),
`ui::pipboy::repair::tests` (the lines' order, what each does, closing),
`armour_wears_and_loses_its_threshold`, `a_hit_wears_the_players_armour`
and `broken_things_come_off_and_stay_off` (`crates/world/tests/repair.rs`).
Seen in the viewer at Mick & Ralph's (`--open-menu
repair:FreesideMickREF`): Repair 75, mending to 85%; a 9mm pistol at 30%
for 110 caps; clicking it paid 110 caps and left it at 85%, "CANNOT
REPAIR PAST 85%". The Pip-Boy in Doc Mitchell's house with three 9mm
pistols at 30% and Repair 15 (`--pipboy items:0 --pipboy-keys r,down,enter`):
the screen lists the pistol in brackets and its two spares, "CHOOSE ITEM TO
REPAIR WITH"; on a spare "+9%" (3.875 → 38.75%) and DAM 6 → 7; Enter mends
it, one spare left.

## Not done

- The tutorial message the repair screen asks for as it opens
  (`00718630(6, 1035, 500)`), the pad's buttons closing it (`007b6a50`,
  `DoGamepadUpEvent` codes 6 and 10).
- An item's condition is kept per holder and kind (weapons and armour,
  `GameState::weapon_health`): a repair or wear touches every one of a kind
  the holder has, where the game's touch one. Keeping it per instance (as
  the game's inventory entries keep an extra-data list per stack: health,
  weapon mod flags 0x8D, worn 0x16 / 0x17, script, hot key) would replace
  `GameState`'s `items`, `weapon_health`, `weapon_mods` and `equipped`,
  all keyed by holder and kind, with stacks per holder, and make every
  caller pick an instance: equipping the first unworn one, `RemoveItem`
  an unworn one and `RemoveMe` the worn one (`004bfda0`), a repair or a
  fitted mod splitting one off its stack; the save's `weaponhealth` /
  `weaponmods` lines, barter values, combat's weapon in hand, crafting's
  80% products, the Pip-Boy's rows and the repair lines (one per
  instance already) would follow, and NPCs' equipment with them.
- Fatigue damage (no hit here does any), the shotgun's threshold share
  per projectile; a broken weapon an NPC drops stays in their inventory,
  marked dropped (`GameState::dropped`), rather than becoming a reference
  on the ground.
- Weapon mods (a condition mod raising full health, `004bda70(10)`), the
  ammunition's and perk entry 0's part in the damage figure (`006450f0`).
- The dialogue topic handed back when the merchant's menu closes
  (`007b78e0`: `0061a2d0(5, 5)`).
