# Explosives: thrown weapons, grenades and explosions

M2 blocker for Ghost Town Gunfight (`VMS16`, objective 40: Easy Pete hands
out `WeapNVDynamite`). Branch `claude/m2-explosives`, 2026-10-06. Launchers,
explosive missiles, the other grenades and mines (M4): branch
`claude/launchers-mines`, 2026-10-07 (Xbox decompiles of the `Projectile`,
`MissileProjectile`, `GrenadeProjectile`, `Explosion` and `CombatFormulas`
functions in `%USERPROFILE%\nv-re\decomp\launchers`).

Sources: FalloutNV.exe 1.4.0.525 (unpacked image, Ghidra project copy
`ghidra_8`; private exports in `%USERPROFILE%\nv-re\work\explosives-2026-10-06`),
class names from the Xbox 360 prototype symbols (Xbox PDB), records read with
`nvinspect` from `FalloutNV.esm`. Earlier notes: `findings\hits.md` §2,

## Traced behaviour

Addresses are PC function entries; Xbox names where the prototype has them.

- **Record layouts.** `PROJ` `DATA` at form `+0x60`: timer `+0x80`
  (`00644790`), proximity `+0x7c` (`0045cd80`), speed `+0x68`
  (`0069ef80`), bounciness `+0xb0` (`006d2c20`). Flag tests: 0x02
  explosion (`004fd360`), 0x04 alt. trigger (`00975300`), 0x400 detonates
  (`005de080`). `EXPL` `DATA` at `+0x74`: damage `+0x78` (`006a78f0`),
  radius `+0x7c`, flags `+0x88` (`00477950`), image space radius `+0x8c`.
- **Radius units** (`BGSExplosion::GetRadiusBSUnits`, `00477900`): the
  stored radius × `fBSUnitsPerFoot` unless flag 0x01 is set (also for the
  image space radius `009ac550` and radiation radius `009ad5a0`).
- **Throwing** (`00523150`): animation types 10–13 fire from the actor's
  hand node and use up the weapon (the count/unequip step at the end;
  the per-shot decrement through vfunc `+0x3f0` is inferred). Speed
  (`009669c0`, `009bca60`): the record's speed; animation type 13 ×
  (1 + `fThrowingStrengthPenalty` × (STR − Str req)); perk entry 59;
  the AI's high arc × 0.67 (`009cb830` → `00966a00`).
- **Grenade object** (`GrenadeProjectile`, vtable `0108f674`; constructor
  `009b4020`, made for type 2 by `009bd5c0`/`009bca60`). Initialize
  (`009bda10`): the fuse `+0xe4` = the record's timer unless a mine
  (`009bdf80`). Havok setup (`009be0a0`): restitution = bounciness ×
  `fGrenadeRestitution` (the setting alone if bounciness ≤ 0), friction
  `fGrenadeFriction`, when those settings are non-zero.
- **Update** (`GrenadeProjectile::UpdateProjectile`, `009b41b0`): past
  `fGrenadeAgeMax` it is removed (`009bc8f0`); then the explosion check
  (`009c3190`): alt. trigger → fuse −= frame time, explode at ≤ 0 (mines
  with no fuse wait for proximity, `009c39e0`); otherwise explode once the
  impact list is non-empty unless "detonates". Impact-triggered grenades
  explode at the impact point (flag 0x2000 set by `009b40d0`), others at
  their position.
- **Spawn** (`Explosion::SpawnExplosion`, `009ac9c0`; constructor
  `009ac200`; `Explosion::Initialize`, `009acd60`): radius = record radius
  × player perk entry 72 "Adjust Explosion Radius" (asked about the
  weapon) when the projectile's shooter is the player.
- **Targets** (`Explosion::InitHavok`, `009ae280`: a phantom sphere of the
  radius) and **damage** (`Explosion::ProcessTargets`, `009b00a0`): per
  target, share = 1 − (d/R)² inside R (`00647920`, d from the explosion to
  the target's position); damage = `Explosion::GetDamage` (`009b0f80` with
  `006479e0`) × share; actors must pass `Explosion::RunLOSPick`
  (`009b1810`); the hit is built by `009b5770` (attacker = the explosion's
  actor cause, weapon, flag 0x2000: armour `009b5a30`, critical
  `009b7060`, multiplier `009b73d0`) and handled by `0089a760`.
- **GetDamage**: (`fDamageGunWeapCondBase` + `…Mult`) × record damage;
  with an actor cause and weapon × (`fDamageSkillBase` + `fDamageSkillMult`
  × skill × 0.01).
- **Line of sight** (`009b1810`): skipped with flag 0x10. A cast from the
  explosion to the target; each hit blocks unless (component 2 of a vector
  built from the hit, read here as the ray's z, < −0.98 and the hit is
  within `fExplosionLOSBuffer`) or it belongs to the source. Actors with
  3D get six more points ±2 × a radius (`0084d030`, `+0xc`) on each axis.
- **After the hit** (`009b00a0`): the explosion's object effect (`EITM`,
  the form's `+0x68`) is cast on the target by the actor cause's caster
  (`+0x88`), else the explosion's own (`+0x37`); then, for the living, the
  record's flag 0x04 always, or 0x08 by `CombatFormulas::CheckKnockdown`
  (`00646400`), pushes the actor down (`Explosion::PushActor`, `009b0d70`).
  `00646400`: only if the hit leaves them alive; damage over 75 % of full
  health always; else over `fKnockdownCurrentHealthThreshold` % of health
  now gives (damage × 0.3) ÷ (Agility × 10), at most 0.25, against a roll
  of 1000. The damage is the explosion's at their distance before armour
  (`HitData::InitializeExplosionData`, hit `+0x14`).
- **Limb targets** (`Explosion::FindTargets` / `CheckLimbTarget` /
  `AddLimbTarget`, Xbox): each Havok body of an actor overlapping the
  sphere adds its body part, keeping the two nearest per actor; how the
  hit then uses them isn't read. **Forces** (`009b0920`), **shudder** and
  image space: read, not implemented (physics and effects).
- **Missiles** (`MissileProjectile`): they move by their speed along their
  heading (`009bf300`) through a Havok character controller
  (`ProjectileListener`, made by `Projectile::InitHavok` `009be0a0` →
  `009c6440`) whose gravity is the projectile's (`00966980`: 1 for lobbers,
  else `PROJ` gravity; ÷ the time multiplier under the shooter's Turbo):
  so they fall (`MobileObject::Move`). Run-time flag 0x40 (gravity without
  hitscan, `009b7cc0`) only turns the model to its way (`009bf470`, its
  sole reader). A missile striking someone hits them as a bullet would
  (`Projectile::ProcessImpacts`, Xbox: `CombatHit` with the projectile's
  damage), then explodes where it struck (`009c3190`).
- **Ammunition's projectile**: `AMMO` `DAT2` form at 4, else the weapon's.
- **The AI's danger test** (`CombatManager::CheckExplosionAttack`,
  `00992720`, asked by the attack procedures `009d0a30`, `009cb380`, …):
  record damage ≥ `fDangerousProjectileExplosionDamage`, and the distance
  where its blast still does that much (radius × √(1 − 5 ÷ damage),
  `006479a0` → `00647960`) ≥ `fDangerousProjectileExplosionRadius`: then
  those within it of the aim point (`00992ba0`) refuse the attack: the
  attacker, their combat group, and spectators when the attacker's
  Responsibility ≥ 50, each unless the combat style's flag 0x20 / 0x40 /
  0x80 ("ignore damaging self / group / spectators", `009928c0`).
- **Mines**: no fuse at launch (`009bda10`); each frame
  (`Projectile::CheckExplosion` `009c3190`) an alt.-trigger projectile with
  a proximity and no fuse runs `Projectile::CheckExplosionProximity`
  (`009c39e0`): the high-process actors within the proximity (×
  `fMineExteriorRadiusMult` outdoors) it reacts to
  (`Projectile::GetMineReactsToTarget` `009c3930`: not its layer unless
  `iProjectileMineShooterCanTrigger`, not the dead, not its owner
  faction's members, its layer's reaction neutral or enemy), then the
  player, who sets it off only if a roll of 100 is under their perks'
  entry point 4 "Calculate Mine Explode Chance" (Light Step: 0); a failed
  roll spares the player from then on (flag 0x4000). The fuse: for
  characters Explosives × the record's timer ÷ 100 + `fMinesDelayMin`, for
  creatures `fMinesDelayMin`. It then counts down and blinks every
  (slow − fast) ÷ max × fuse + fast seconds (slow above `fMinesBlinkMax`),
  restarting the countdown sound. There is no arming delay in the code.
  Mines last for `fMineAgeMax` (0: for ever, `009b41b0`).
- **Disarming** (`BGSProjectile::Activate`, Xbox; `Projectile::TurnOff`
  `009c43e0`): E on an armed mine whose record "can be disabled" turns it
  off (flag 0x200; the disable sound, `DATA` form at 60); when its fuse was
  running or it reacts to the one disarming, the "Mines Disarmed"
  statistic and `iMineDisarmExperience`. E on a disarmed one that "can be
  picked up" takes it. The crosshair says "Disarm Mine" (`sDisarmMine`)
  while armed, "Take" after (`00775a00` at `007778fe`).
- **AI throws** (`CombatProcedureAttackGrenade`, `009cafe0`; aim
  `009cb6e0` → `009a8bf0` → `009a8df0` → `009a8f00`): aim mode (`009a8bf0`):
  2 for a high arc of a falling projectile, 4 (feet, `009a8460`) for
  splash damage, else 1 (half height); pitch (`009a7c60`): the low/high
  root of the ballistic equation, 45° when out of reach; aim point
  z = tan(pitch) × x + origin z. Arc choice (`009a7670`): low first, then
  high; a path test (`009a6e90`, `iBallisticProjectilePathPickSegments`)
  must not be blocked before `fGrenadeThrowHitFractionThreshold`.
- **Band** (`009a9180`): an exploding projectile keeps the minimum range
  at least the explosion radius.

## Implemented

Core (`crates/world`):

- `world::explosions` (new): `ProjectileRecord`, `ExplosionRecord`,
  `falloff`, `base_damage`/`damage_with`, `blast_radius`, `launch_speed`,
  `is_thrown`, `FlightSettings`, `Flight` (launch, step, fuse, expiry),
  `los_clear`, `blast_targets`, `aim_mode`, `aim_height`, `launch_pitch`,
  `aim_point`, `arc_clear`. Translated functions carry their address.
- `Runner::explosion_hit` (`world::scripting`): `OnHit`/`OnHitWith`,
  armour, critical, health, `OnDeath`, crime and fighting back.
- `combat_ai::ranged_band_blast`; perk entries 4, 59 and 72.
- `projectiles::missile_gravity`, `Missile::stretch` (the fall);
  `combat::fired_projectile`; `explosions::cast_enchantment`,
  `knocks_down`, `knockdown_by_formula`, `explosion_attack_allowed`,
  `reach_of_damage`; `Flight::set_off`, mines' age.
- `mines` (new): `MineSettings`, `reacts_to`, `check_proximity`,
  `fuse_for`, `blink_interval`, `activation`, `disarm`, `placed_in`,
  `take`, `use_placed`, saved `minedisarmed` / `minegone` lines;
  `activation::info` "Disarm Mine".

Viewer:

- `explosives` (new): throw queue, launch (AI arc choice against the
  cell collision, using up the weapon), flight through the collision,
  explosion sounds, hits on everyone alive in range and sight, hit reports.
- `combat`: the player's attack throws weapons of types 10–13.
- `fighting`: people holding one keep out of its blast and throw it;
  people don't fire or throw explosives whose blast would catch their own
  side (`blast_is_safe`); their shots use the ammunition's projectile.
- `bolts`: rockets, 40 mm and 25 mm grenades and the Fat Man's nuke fly as
  bolts and fall under their gravity; explode where they strike.
- `explosives`: the explosion's object effect and knockdown (logged; the
  fall isn't played); placed mines of the player's place and laid mines
  go off for whoever comes near, count down and explode; `scripts`: E
  disarms a placed mine (sound, XP), then takes it.

## Tested (generated inputs, no game files)

`world` integration tests `crates/world/tests/launchers_mines.rs` (7, on
`testdata::launchers` with the game's values: ammunition projectiles,
gravity, EMP cast, knockdowns, the danger test, mine proximity, owners,
Light Step, the layer, disarming, taking, saving, a laid mine's fuse);
`projectiles::tests` (a 40 mm grenade aimed as the AI aims comes down on
its target).

`world` unit tests `explosions::tests` (15: record parsing, radius units,
falloff, damage, restitution, fuse/landing/rest, impact grenades, expiry,
line of sight incl. the floor buffer and offset points, targets, launch
pitch, aim point, aim mode, arc test); `combat_ai::tests::
dynamite_keeps_its_thrower_out_of_the_blast`; integration test
`scripting::explosions_hurt_through_the_hit_path`; viewer
`explosives::tests` (normals, queue).

## Test scenes (live, release viewer, 2026-10-07)

Mines (the mined corridor of `NorthVegasHouseTools`, eleven frag mines):

```powershell
nv-viewer.exe "<Data>" NorthVegasHouseTools --at 3152,3580,7616,180,55 `
  --walk --freeze-ai --run "player.modav health 1000" `
  --run "player.addperk LightStep" --key-at 3 e --key-at 4 e `
  --run-at 5 "player.removeperk LightStep" --run-at 5.5 "player.MoveTo 000EBA66" `
  --screenshot shot.png --wait 9
```

Seen: "E) Disarm Mine / Frag Mine" under the crosshair (red: owned), no
mine set off while Light Step is held; E: "Disarmed 000EBAAB", "XP +5",
the prompt turns to "E) Take"; E: "Frag Mine added"; without the perk,
standing among the rest, three are set off (0.65 s fuse: Explosives 15 ×
3 ÷ 100 + 0.2) and hurt the player by the falloff (96.9 at 34 units, 99.9
at 5, 86.9 at 69); the one 97 units away that had spared the player under
Light Step stays quiet (flag 0x4000).

Launchers (Goodsprings, `WastelandNV --at -68250,5800,8480,180,0 --walk
--freeze-ai --weapon WeapNVGrenadeRifle|WeapMissileLauncher --key-at 5
mouse-left --wait 9`): the 40 mm grenade fired level struck the ground
1032 units out, 164 below the eye (the controller's fall over 0.58 s);
the rocket flew straight 1015 units into the house; damage 57.5 (100 ×
1.0 × (0.5 + 0.5 × Explosives 15 ÷ 100)) and 115.

## Not compared / gaps (labelled in code)

- Nothing compared with the original game yet (fuse timing, throw arcs,
  damage at distance, who is shielded).
- The grenade is a point with a simple contact response, not Havok's rigid
  body (shape, spin, the surface's friction, the model's own restitution
  when a setting is 0). It collides with the world only, not with actors.
- The LOS vector's identity in `009b1810` and `fExplosionLOSBufferDistance`
  (24)'s use are not resolved; the target point is its position (feet);
  bodies use the people's controller radius for the offsets.
- Throw origin (eye for the player, 60 units up for people), immediate
  release (no throw animation timing), target height 128 for the aim.
- Not done: models (projectile, explosion), light, image space, decals,
  camera shake, the mines' blinking light, forces on bodies (forces on
  clutter: [PHYSICS.md](PHYSICS.md), `009b0920`), the knockdown's fall
  (`009b0d70`: decided and logged only), limb damage from blasts (the
  limb targets are read, their use isn't), damage to destructible objects
  (mines shot or caught in a blast don't go off: `DEST`), the planner
  switching NPCs to grenades or mines (only the weapon in hand is used),
  homing missiles (`ProjectileTarget`, `AimAtPoint` `009c6030`), the
  character controller's own limits on a missile's fall (taken as free
  fall), Turbo's share of the gravity, `DisableAllMines`, E on mines the
  player laid (they aren't references here), and V.A.T.S. grenade aiming.
- The AI's danger test counts "their side" as faction allies and friends
  (the game's combat group, `00992ba0`, isn't modelled) and bystanders as
  everyone else who isn't a target.
- Disarming a placed mine credits the player by whether it reacts to them
  (whether its fuse was running isn't passed from the viewer).
- The line of sight of an explosion on the floor ignores the surface the
  ray starts on (the collider's triangles are two-sided; a hit at 0).
- Explosion hit reports carry the thrower's weapon, so the hit sounds are
  the weapon's impact set (which set the game uses for blasts isn't
  traced).

Next action: in the original game, fire the grenade rifle level from the
test scene's spot (where it lands), disarm a `NorthVegasHouseTools` mine
(XP, prompt) and walk onto the next (fuse), comparing with the scenes
above.
