# Opening Doc look IK trace

## Implementation, 2026-10-06

`crates/world/src/look_ik.rs` ports the controller; `viewer/src/look.rs`
runs it on placed people after animation sampling (`ActorRig::pose_now`)
and before skinning. Status: implemented and unit-tested. Pure helpers are
checked against the original's code on the real CPU (nv-call); the whole
behaviour has **not** been compared with the original game.

Names come from the Xbox 360 prototype's PDB (`Fallout_Release_MemDebug`,
Xbox PDB). The PC layout matches `bhkRagdollController` (Xbox PDB) with
the PC 0xC bytes shorter before `bInitLookIK` and 0x10 shorter from
`CurrentHeadRotOffset`, checked against the PC constructor 00c7f060 and
the functions below:

| PC | Field (Xbox PDB) |
| --- | --- |
| +0x10 | `WorldFromModel` (hkQsTransform) |
| +0x54 | `pHeadPose` (two-bone head/eye pose) |
| +0x88 | `pSGPose` (scene-graph pose) |
| +0xb0..b3 | `bInitLookIK`, `bEnableLookIK`, `bEaseOutLookIK`, `bActiveLookIK` |
| +0xc0 | `CurrentHeadRotOffset` |
| +0xd0 | `CurrentTargetWS` |
| +0xf0 | `BoneParamA[2]` (0x50 each: `pPose`, `ssBoneIdx`, `ssParentIdx`, `fLookAtMaxAngle`, `FwdLS`, `FwdParentMS`, `PrevRotLS`, `bLimitBoneRot`, `bActive`, `fDeadHeading`, `fDeadPitch`) |
| +0x190 | `bUseHeadPose` |
| +0x194 | `eCurrentBone` (0 `EYE_BONE`, 1 `HEAD_BONE`) |
| +0x19c / +0x1a0 | `fEyeHeading` / `fEyePitch` |
| +0x1a4 | `bTargetBehind` (not "below") |

Function pairs confirmed by these field uses: 008a3b70
`SetLookAtIKTarget`, 00c75580 `SetLookIKActive`, 00c755e0 `LimitBoneRot`
(returns the angle applied), 00c78160 `AdjustCurrentTarget`, 00c78610
`BoneTrack` (returns true when the target is outside the cone), 00c79340
`InitBoneParams`, 00c7aa60 `DoLookAtIK`, 00c7d630 `DoRagdollAnim`,
00c7de60 `InitLookIK`, 00c7f060 the constructor (all Xbox PDB names).

Behaviour traced (PC addresses):
- Set-up (0087e130): the first body part with IK data (BPND flag 0x02)
  and head tracking (0x20) gives the head bone (BPNI) and its maximum
  angle (BPND f32 at 0x14, degrees). Actors whose `IsCreature` (PC vtable
  +0x21c; Xbox +0x218) is false get `bUseHeadPose`, a two-bone pose with
  the eye 9, 6, 0 game units from the head, tracked inside the head frame.
- `InitBoneParams`: `FwdLS` is model +Y in the bone's frame (inverse
  rotation, normalized over xyz), `FwdParentMS` the same in the parent's
  frame (not normalized). Note the native vector rotations come in both
  directions; each is classified by its cross-product term.
- `AdjustCurrentTarget`: targets behind (local Y < 0) move 5 Havok units
  to the side of the eye point; while easing out the target is 3 units
  ahead of the head; the stored target is kept within 5 Havok units.
- `BoneTrack`: the cone around the parent-carried forward
  (`fLookAtMaxAngle`, 60 degrees by default, the body part's value for
  the head), the turn solve 00ce0290 including the eye-offset correction
  asin(offset / distance), then `LimitBoneRot` caps the change to
  `fAngleMax` 3.5 (easing out `fAngleMaxEase` 1.0) degrees per update;
  easing ends below `fEaseAngleShutOff` 0.5 degrees.
- `DoLookAtIK`: head first (when the head is active or there is no head
  pose), `CurrentHeadRotOffset` applied, then the eye bone; the eye's
  heading/pitch are pi/2 - acos of its forward against -Z and +X.
- Units: Havok, game units / 6.9991255 (011b02ec; 01267c20 and
  011c582c are set from it). Settings: the INI files set no LookIK
  values (their `fLookAtGain`/`fLookAtTargetGain` aren't registered), so
  the constructor defaults apply; `bLookIK`/`bRagdollAnim` default 1.
- Target point: the player in first person is looked at at the camera
  (00952ff0); other actors at their head node (008a2fa0).

Oracle evidence (nv-call, image SHA-256 19406942...739F, AMD Ryzen AI 9
HX 370): 005611c0 (normalize), 00c66320, 00c74ac0, 00c74c20, 00cb2450 and
six 00ce0290 cases (with and without the eye offset, cone clamp) are
regression tests in `look_ik.rs`; private vectors and scripts in
`%USERPROFILE%\nv-re\work\lookik-2026-10-06\`. The x87 listing of
00ce0a49 (`FMUL ST1`) stores into ST1; reading it the other way gives the
wrong correction.

Unresolved (labelled in the code):
- The target choice of 008a3100/008a3ed0 is not ported; the viewer uses
  `ai`'s look-at target or the dialogue speaker's listener, and only the
  player as target (NPC-to-NPC tracking is not driven).
- The model frame is taken as the skeleton root's (+Y forward); the
  native SG pose's root (via `pRagdollRoot`) is not traced.
- The head-pose head bone's local transform (00a86bf0) is taken as the
  identity; `bEnableRagdollAnim` (+0x41) gating isn't modelled.
- The eye heading/pitch go through 00888970 (process vfunc +0x144's
  object) to 00888a20, which stores them as `BSFaceGenAnimationData`
  `fDesiredEyeHeading`/`fDesiredEyePitch` (+0x150/+0x154, Xbox PDB);
  that FaceGen eye update (toward `fCurrentEyeHeading`/`Pitch`, +0x140,
  and the eye nodes) is not traced, so eyes don't move yet.
- Precision: SSE estimates use exact reciprocals (tier C) and x87
  extended precision is approximated with f64.

## Follow-up output trace, 2026-10-04

No runtime gaze change is implemented. Ghidra assembly confirms mode1's
active call at `00c7aa8f..00c7aab0`, selected node+0x144, second transform
selector+0x146 and quaternion cache+0x170..0x17c. `00c78610` rebuilds the
selected/subtree transforms and passes its selected quaternion through
`00c755e0`, which caps the relative rotation and writes both node and cache.

The final `005611c0`/`005611e0` correction is now resolved as quaternion
normalization: sum four squared components, reciprocal square root with one
Newton refinement, then scale all four components. The native implementation
uses SSE approximations, so bit-identical results need separate validation.

The cap selects `01267d24` or `01267d30` using controller+0xb2 and converts
degrees to radians. No delta-time factor appears in this helper: the cap is
per invocation. Although both globals are zero in the executable image,
constructors `00fbd100`/`00fbd130` register `fAngleMax:LookIK` default 3.5
and `fAngleMaxEase:LookIK` default 1.0 respectively. Post-INI runtime values
remain unverified; see the constructor evidence below.
The second mode0 call uses a temporary transform and changes+0x181 and
feedback metrics; it is not merely an inert cache update.

Remaining requirements: verify post-INI cap values, identify
the per-mode+0x110/+0xf6 setup and skeleton transform spaces, establish the
quaternion product convention, then compare a port in the original game.

## Earlier trace

Research status, 2026-10-03. FNV executable addresses below refer to the
existing `nv-re/decomp/codex-m1` Ghidra project. No runtime behavior has been
implemented from this trace.

## Confirmed native path

Doc's actor update `008a3100` chooses a tracked actor, obtains its anchor from
the target actor's virtual `+0x194` method, and calls `008a3b70` on the actor's
controller stored at actor `+0xac`. `008a3b70` writes the supplied xyz into
controller `+0xd0` (fourth component zero), then invokes `00c75580` to enable
the look system. The controller is created by `0087e130` through constructor
`00c7f060`; its initialization path includes a specific LookIK initialization
failure diagnostic.

The visual consumer is verified, including register/stack roles:
`00c7d630` has the controller in ECX and passes `this+0x10` on the stack to
`00c7aa60` (`dis_00c7d630.txt`, `00c7d744-00c7d747`). The callee keeps ECX as
the controller and calls `00c78160` with that same `this`. `00c78160` reads
controller `+0xd0`, alongside its matrix at `+0x10`, and calls `00c7f840`.
That helper subtracts matrix translation from target xyz, applies the inverse
controller rotation to get a local direction, and normalizes it. Thus the
target-to-local-direction transform is established and this is the actor's
LookIK path, not a generic look-at inference.

`00c78160` records whether the local target is below in controller `+0x1a4`.
The below-target branch is conditional on state byte `+0xb2`; it uses signed
clamp values `+5` and `-5` before mapping through selected skeleton
transforms. It also limits movement of the smoothed point to 5 native units
per update (`[011b05a8]`, `00c78598-00c785f0`). The precise coordinate
meaning and units of those clamps are not yet established.

`00c7aa60` calls `00c78610` with its second argument 1 for the active result,
then calls it again with that argument 0, using a temporary matrix. `00c78610`
reads the same target at controller `+0xd0`, selected skeleton index `+0x144`,
and per-mode index at `+0xf4`/`+0xf6`. Its body builds and composes quaternion
transforms and writes node transforms, but the Ghidra output is too large and
ambiguous to claim the final rotation formula or limits without tracing the
exact output writes and helpers.

## Unresolved, exact next trace

The controller constructor initializes short `+0x144` to `-1`. The setter is
now found in `00c79340`: it writes the result of `00cdd390` to
`controller + mode * 0x50 + 0xf4`; mode1 therefore writes `+0x144`.
`00c7de60` calls it with mode1. Its sole caller is `0087e575`, passing the
string returned through `0063d040 -> 00559450` from the body-part iterator
at local `-0x290`. **Assembly confirms the name is BPNI**: `0063d04a`
adds0x14 before the string getter; Ghidra's C output omitted that adjustment.
The loader `005e427c` checks BPNI and `005e42b0` writes its string at+0x14.
The iterator (`005e5320`) scans 15 BPTD part slots+0x34, selecting flag0x02;
`0087e940` selects flag0x20 for LookIK. DefaultBodyPartData0000001D's Head
entry has flags0x3b and BPNI `Bip01 Head`. Thus mode1's selected node is
data-driven, and is Bip01 Head for the standard human body data. BPNN is
different (Bip01 Neck1, stored at+4); do not confuse the two. The temporary
Ghidra project lock cleared. Evidence: look-node-getter.txt,
look-body-strings.txt and look-body-data.txt in nv-re/work/codex-m1.

For output rotation, continue `00c78610` from its call with second argument 1
in `00c7aa60`: label each transform source (`+0x110..+0x11c`, per-node data,
target local direction), follow the final writes to the selected node's
rotation, and decompile only helpers on that dataflow. Separately trace
`00c755e0` if it contributes the angle or easing value. Confirm whether the
second call (second argument 0) is just a temporary/cache update. These are the
minimum gaps before a runtime implementation can reproduce native behavior.

The opening's `SayTo Player` is a scripted talk event, not a dialogue package;
it is an explicit reason for Doc to have the player as a target, but the
viewer currently has no native actor look-target/effect wiring. Random
`SitChairRelax` idle variation is separate from the absent gaze behavior.
`viewer/src/faces.rs` documents that head-turn and eye tracking are absent;
the seated body-turn guard in `viewer/src/ai.rs` must remain intact.

## Evidence locations

Follow-up, 2026-10-04: `00c755e0` caps a relative quaternion per invocation
(no delta time in this helper). Constructors `00fbd100` and `00fbd130`
register `fAngleMax:LookIK` default 3.5 at `01267d24` and
`fAngleMaxEase:LookIK` default 1.0 at `01267d30`. Controller byte `+0xb2`
selects the value; multiplication by 0.0174533 converts degrees to radians.
These are constructor defaults, not verified post-INI runtime values.
`005611c0`/`005611e0` normalize the quaternion using four-component norm
and reciprocal square root refinement, with a zero guard. The mode0 call
updates `+0x181` and feedback metrics; it is not merely an inert cache.
Mode1 selects the `+0x144` node and caches quaternion `+0x170..+0x17c`.
The precise `+0x110`/`+0xf6` setup, transform conventions and original-game
comparison still block a faithful runtime port. Private evidence and 38-file
