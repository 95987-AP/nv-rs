//! Pickpocketing, read from the game's code (`findings\living.md` §3:
//! `005fa330`, `0075dc80`, `0075e240`, `0075e0b0`, `00643400`, the crime
//! `008c00e0`, live grenades `0075d510`).
//!
//! **Using a person** (`005fa330`): someone unconscious (`SetUnconscious`)
//! answers "<name> is unconscious." (`sNoTalkUnConscious`), someone
//! fleeing "<name> is fleeing." (`sNoTalkFleeing`); the dead are searched
//! (their inventory opens as a container); a living person who isn't the
//! player's teammate, used by the player **while sneaking**, has their
//! pockets picked, unless they have caught the player before: "<name> has
//! already caught you." (`sNoPickPocketAgain`; names and texts joined as
//! `%s %s`). A teammate brings up their wheel, or nothing when they can't
//! take orders (`00754d90`, [`crate::companions::wheel_allowed`]). Anyone
//! else is talked to. Facing, light and being seen play
//! no part. (Creatures' own "allow pickpocket" and a few process flags in
//! the test aren't read: only people are pickpocketed here.)
//!
//! **Each stack moved** (`0075dc80`): taking, the value V is the item's
//! value × the count (`0075e240`); stacks the player put there themselves
//! are taken back without a roll. Placing, V is 1 whatever the item. The
//! chance (`00643400`) is the sum of `fPickPocketActorSkillBase`,
//! `…ActorSkillMult` × your Sneak, `…TargetSkillBase`, `…TargetSkillMult`
//! × their Sneak, `…AmountBase` and `…AmountMult` × V, cut to a whole
//! number and clamped to `fPickPocketMinChance` … `MaxChance`: with the
//! data's settings clamp(40 + 0.6 × yours − 0.6 × theirs − 0.5 × V, 5, 85).
//! No perk takes part. The roll (`0075e0b0`): none when V ≤ 0; otherwise a
//! random 0–99 succeeds below the chance, and either way −5 karma
//! (`fKarmaModStealing`) unless the person's own karma is evil. Success
//! moves the stack; the first theft of a visit counts in "Pockets Picked"
//! (misc stat 13). Failure moves nothing and closes the screen: "You've
//! been caught pickpocketing." (`sPickpocketFail`), the person won't let
//! the player try again, and the crime (`008c00e0`) unless they ignore
//! crime: +1 minor crime and `fReputationMinorCrimeNeg` infamy for their
//! crime-tracking factions (`008b7c00`), the same record of the day as
//! thefts kept on the player: the first crime notes the day of the month;
//! a later one on that day makes them attack, one on another day clears
//! the note.
//!
//! Items here are whole and unmodded, so a stack's value is its record's
//! (the game's value of worn or modded items, `004bd400`, isn't traced).
//!
//! Not traced, and so not done: the warning that follows a crime
//! (`008bf500` gives the person a PickpocketWarning package, type 0x23,
//! the first `iPickPocketWarnings` times: how it walks and what ends it);
//! live grenades (`0075d510`: placing a thrown or placed weapon with a
//! lobber projectile, [`is_live_grenade`], on someone living and not
//! essential while sneaking arms a projectile on them with a fuse of
//! `fProjectileInventoryGrenadeTimer` 2 s instead of moving it: the
//! projectile, its explosion and the process test at +0x388 aren't here,
//! so the item is placed like any other); a person "trespassing" themselves
//! (no crime then).
