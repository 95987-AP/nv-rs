//! Hardcore mode's needs (dehydration, hunger, sleep deprivation) and the
//! radiation stages, read from the game's code (`findings\living.md` §4).
//!
//! **Growing** (`00969c30`, each frame of play in hardcore and before each
//! waited or slept hour): nothing while scripts have the Pip-Boy turned off
//! (`DisablePlayerControls`; the clocks wait, so the time counts once it's
//! back). The time is `GameDaysPassed` × 24 × 60 game minutes; each need
//! has a clock and a step of `rate × TimeScale / 60` game minutes, i.e. one
//! point per `rate` real seconds of game time: Dehydration (actor value 73)
//! `fHCDehydrationRate` 10 (the exe's; not in the data), Sleep Deprivation
//! (75) `fHCSleepDeprivationRate` 50, Hunger (74) `fHCStarvationRate` 25 (the
//! data's), in that order. Once a step has passed, the value rises by the
//! whole steps passed and the clock jumps to now (the fraction is dropped).
//! Sleep deprivation's clock moves on the same way while the player sleeps
//! through the menu, but nothing is added. A clock of 0 (a new game, a
//! loaded one) puts all three at now first.
//!
//! **Stages** (`DEHY`, `HUNG`, `SLPD`, and `RADS` for radiation: `DATA` u32
//! threshold, u32 spell): kept highest threshold first (`004016a0` inserts
//! a record before the first with a lower threshold); a value's stage is
//! the first whose threshold it reaches (`004018b0`). New Vegas: 200, 400,
//! 600, 800, 1000; stages 1–4 diseases lowering SPECIAL, 5 an ability
//! doing 10000 damage to Health.
//!
//! **When a value changes** (the actor-value callbacks `008c5350` rads,
//! `008c5610` dehydration, `008c5890` hunger, `008c5b10` sleep; the player
//! only): if the stage differs, the old stage's spell is taken off
//! (`00824400`) and the new one given; then two notices: "…increased" when
//! it went up, else "…decreased", and "You are now sick with <spell's
//! name>" (`sRadiationSick` + `%s %s`), or the "no longer" text when no
//! stage is left. Nothing when the stage stays. Lowering goes through the
//! actor value's flag 0x200: a *Restore* lowers these, a *Damage* raises
//! them (`world::magic::change`; `WaterPurified` restores Dehydration 50).
//!
//! **Hardcore off** (`SetHardcore 0`, `00969e90`): "always hardcore" is
//! cleared and the three needs are set to 0 (in the order 73, 75, 74, so
//! their spells come off through the stages).
