//! Effects on people and creatures: what aid items, spells and abilities do
//! to their actor values, and for how long.
//!
//! An item or spell lists its effects (`EFID` + `EFIT`, read by
//! [`crate::items::effects`]); each names a magic effect (`MGEF`) whose
//! `DATA` says how it works. Read from the records and checked against
//! what the game's items are known to do:
//!
//! - **Recover** (flag 0x02): the value comes back when the effect ends,
//!   so it's a modifier while it lasts. Buffout's "Increase Strength"
//!   (0x72) has it: +2 Strength for 240 s, then back.
//! - Without it the change stays: at once with no duration, else the
//!   magnitude every second for the duration ("Restore Health" 0x70: a
//!   Nuka-Cola's 2 for 25 s heals 50 over 25 s).
//! - **Detrimental** (flag 0x04) lowers the value; the resisting actor
//!   value (at 16) takes its percentage off ("Damage Rads" is resisted by
//!   Rad Resistance, 20).
//! - **Script** effects (archetype 1) run their script (the associated
//!   item, at 8) on whoever they affect: `ScriptEffectStart` once,
//!   `ScriptEffectUpdate` while they last, `ScriptEffectFinish` at the end.
//!   Nuka-Cola's cap effect is `additem caps001 1` at the start.
//!
//! Rads, dehydration, hunger and sleep deprivation count up as they're
//! "damaged": the game's own scripts read `player.getav RadiationRads >=
//! 200` (`CGTutorialSCRIPT`) and cure with `player.RestoreAV
//! RadiationRads 1000` (the doctors' dialogue).
//!
//! Guesses: changes over time are applied smoothly rather than once a
//! second; resistance scales a detrimental change by (1 − resistance /
//! 100); a script effect with no duration runs start, update and finish
//! in one go; abilities and diseases last while held, other spells given
//! with `AddSpell` are cast once; nothing ends an effect early on death
//! but the death itself.
