//! Who's hostile to whom: factions (`FACT`) and aggression.
//!
//! A faction's `XNAM`s are its relations: the other faction, a modifier
//! (i32), and the combat reaction (u32: 0 neutral, 1 enemy, 2 ally, 3
//! friend). Checked: `GeneralHostileToPlayerFaction` ("Hostile to the
//! player only.") names `PlayerFaction` (`0001B2A4`) with 1; the NCR's
//! relation to the player is 0. People list their factions in `SNAM`s
//! (faction, rank; from their template when its flags say so); the
//! player is in `PlayerFaction`.
//!
//! Scripts change both, and the game's hostilities come from them: the
//! Powder Gangers' records make them neutral to the player, and
//! `VFreeformNCRCFScript` or `VES04FactReactPGDeathScript` run `SetEnemy
//! PowderGangerFactionNV PlayerFaction`. `SetEnemy F1 F2 [a b]` makes the
//! two enemies (each flag 1 instead leaves that side neutral), `SetAlly F1
//! F2 [a b]` allies (a flag 1 makes that side a friend), as the editor
//! documents them; the changes are kept in the game state.
//!
//! Whether someone attacks the player on sight, by their aggression
//! (`AIDT` byte 0) and the reaction of their factions, read from the
//! game's code ([`attacks_on_sight`], [`reaction`]). Reputations (`REPU`)
//! and crimes aren't counted yet.
