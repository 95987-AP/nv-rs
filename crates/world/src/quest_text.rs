//! What the HUD's quest text is told: a quest added, completed or failed,
//! and custom text such as a place discovered. Read from FalloutNV.exe
//! 1.4.0.525, with the Xbox 360 prototype's names (`QuestUpdateManager`,
//! `HUDMainMenu`; Xbox PDB). The HUD's side (the queue, the letters
//! appearing one by one, the objectives' lines) is `ui::quest_text`.
//!
//! - `0077a480` queues a quest's update (`QuestUpdateManager::QuestUpdate`,
//!   0x324 bytes: the quest at +0, its type at +4: `HQUT_ADD` 0,
//!   `HQUT_COMPLETE` 1, `HQUT_FAILED` 2, `HQUT_CUSTOM` 3). The type is the
//!   quest's state as it's queued: failed (the quest's flag 0x40), else
//!   completed (0x02), else added. A completed or failed quest stops being
//!   the active one; an added one becomes it when there's none.
//! - Its callers: an objective shown (`005ec5d0` with state 1) the first
//!   time for its quest (the quest's flag 0x20, set then and cleared by
//!   `ResetQuest`, `0060d720`); completing a quest (`0060ca30`: not
//!   completed before; `CompleteQuest`, `005c7280`, and a stage's
//!   "complete quest" entry, `0060fb60`); failing one (`0060caf0`: neither
//!   completed nor failed before; it sets both flags; a stage's "fail
//!   quest" entry).
//! - `SetCustomQuestText` (`0076b960`): a title, a subtitle, a queue
//!   priority (`HCQQP_NOW` 0 goes first, `HCQQP_NORMAL` 1 and
//!   `HCQQP_LAST` 2 after; the queue is sorted by priority, `0076bb00`), a
//!   justification (`HCQTJ_LEFT` 0, `CENTER` 1, `RIGHT` 2), the title's
//!   and subtitle's fonts (-1 the HUD's own; font 1, 0, isn't allowed and
//!   becomes -1) and a sound. Its one caller is the compass (`00779070`): a
//!   map marker found gives `sDiscoveredText` over the marker's name, left,
//!   normal priority, the HUD's fonts, `UIPopUpQuestNew`.
