//! Mines: placed (`PGRE` references) or laid by a thrower (weapon
//! animation types 11 and 12), as the game runs them (read from
//! FalloutNV.exe 1.4.0.525 with Ghidra; class and function names from the
//! Xbox 360 prototype's symbols, marked (Xbox PDB); evidence and gaps in
//! `docs/EXPLOSIVES.md`).
//!
//! - A mine is a grenade projectile whose record has the "alt. trigger"
//!   flag and a proximity (`GrenadeProjectile::IsMine`, `009bdf80`;
//!   [`crate::explosions::ProjectileRecord::is_mine`]). Its fuse isn't set
//!   when it's made (`009bda10`): it waits, every frame
//!   (`Projectile::CheckExplosion`, `009c3190`), for someone to come within
//!   its proximity (`Projectile::CheckExplosionProximity`, `009c39e0`:
//!   [`check_proximity`]); that sets the fuse ([`fuse_for`]) and the fuse
//!   then counts down as a grenade's, blinking faster as it runs out
//!   ([`blink_interval`]).
//! - Who sets it off (`Projectile::GetMineReactsToTarget`, `009c3930`:
//!   [`reacts_to`]): the living, not its owner's faction, not its layer's
//!   friends or allies; the player only as their perks' "Calculate Mine
//!   Explode Chance" (entry point 4: Light Step's 0) lets them, once
//!   ([`Mine::spares_player`]).
//! - E on an armed mine disarms it (`BGSProjectile::Activate` (Xbox PDB);
//!   `Projectile::TurnOff`, `009c43e0`: [`disarm`]); E on a disarmed one
//!   takes it: its projectile's default weapon source (the frag mine's
//!   `WeapMineFrag`). See [`activation`].
//! - `fMineAgeMax` (exe 0: never) replaces `fGrenadeAgeMax` for mines
//!   (`009b41b0`).
