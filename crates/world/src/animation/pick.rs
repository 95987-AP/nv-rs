//! What an actor's body plays each frame, as `Actor::PickAnimations`
//! (Xbox PDB, `00895110`) picks it: the movement group for the mover's
//! flags with the weapon kind and movement kind (sneaking) the actor's
//! state gives, looked up with the game's fallbacks
//! ([`super::groups::AnimSet::lookup`]); the walk's rate; drawing and
//! putting away the weapon (the `Equip` and `Unequip` groups, the weapon
//! going to the hand or back at their `Attach`/`Detach` key); the aim while
//! the weapon is drawn (`00888070` → `008b28c0`), the aim cross-fading in
//! over an attack or a draw that ends (`004994f0`); the base idle of the
//! kinds (`sneakmtidle.kf`, `h2hidle.kf`); an idle the idle tree plays in
//! the movement or base section holding it (the anim action 0xd that
//! `00496fe0` sets).
//!
//! And the rules that feed it: whether a non-player sneaks (`00888b50`),
//! wants the weapon out (`008eeec0`, the combat's equip action
//! `009da7c0`), and which direction group a walk facing a point plays
//! (`DetailedActorPathHandler`, Xbox PDB, `009e2aa0`).
//!
//! Read from FalloutNV.exe 1.4.0.525. Not here: jumping (`JumpStart` …),
//! swimming, the weapon up/down sections (their weights come from the aim
//! pitch, `009295c0`, not traced), the attack-speed perk entry (`005e58f0`)
//! and the first-person player's own paths.
