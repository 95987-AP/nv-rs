//! Package begin/end/change actions, read from `POBA`, `POEA`, `POCA`.
//!
//! FalloutNV.exe's package loader (`00673a40`) sends each marker to
//! `0067dd20`: `INAM` is the idle, the embedded script follows, and `TNAM`
//! is the topic and terminates the action. The three actions are independent.
//! For example, VCG01PlayerSection1 begins with the situp idle but changes
//! with the bedsit idle.
//!
//! When they run (FalloutNV.exe 1.4.0.525): the begin action (high-process
//! vfunc +0x598, `00903a80`) when `AddScriptPackage` installs a package
//! (`005cc4f0`) and when the package evaluation starts one (`0090a1a0`,
//! `00907ab0`); the end action (+0x5a0, `00903d10`) when a package's
//! procedures reach `DONE` (`0091ecf0`, once: the process flag +0x5a8)
//! and when a finished package gives way (`00907ab0`); the change action
//! (+0x59c, `00903bf0`) for the script package `AddScriptPackage` replaces
//! and on `ResetAI` (`008a6ce0`). Each runs, in order, the embedded
//! script on the actor (`005ac1e0`), the idle (process vfunc +0x44), and
//! the topic, said through the greeting procedure (vfunc +0x2a4) to no one
//! in particular.
//!
//! Not carried out: a begin action without an idle stops the actor's
//! current idle (+0x44 with none, unless `004985f0`), and an end action's
//! idle under package flag 0x4 sets process flag +0x590; whether the
//! evaluation begins a package again when it re-picks one that reached
//! `DONE` (`0090a1a0`'s branches) isn't followed: a package begins when it
//! changes.
