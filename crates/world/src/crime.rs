//! A faction can hold the player as an enemy for their crimes (its runtime

//! Trespassing (`00546da0`): in a cell with an owner, not public (`DATA`
//! 0x20 or 0x40), with no `XGLB`, that isn't the player's or a faction
//! they're in (at the cell's `XRNK` rank or above). Scripts change owners
//! and the public flag (`SetOwnership`, `SetCellOwnership`,
//! `SetCellPublicFlag`), and who notices (`IgnoreCrime`,
