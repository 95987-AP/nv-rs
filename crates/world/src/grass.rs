//! Grass (`GRAS`): the small plants the game scatters over the terrain
//! wherever a land texture that lists them (`LTEX` `GNAM`) is painted,
//! worked out the way the game's code does it (`FalloutNV.exe`; each rule
//! names the function it was read from).
//!
//! When a square's terrain loads, the game divides each quarter into
//! 512-unit spots and notes, for every grass of every texture painted
//! there, a 3 × 3 grid of densities ([`land_spots`], `0053bc10`). Around the
//! player it then fills the spots: a 6 × 6 grid of candidates per spot, each
//! kept with the density at its place, jittered, dropped onto the terrain
//! and checked against the grass's water and slope limits ([`fill_spot`],
//! `0057de00`). Each kept one gets a brightness and a size from a generator
//! seeded by its own position ([`instance_data`], `00b62de0`), and the
//! grass shader (`GRASS2002.vso`, ported in the viewer's `grass.wgsl`)
//! does the rest: it turns the model to the slope, sways it in the wind,
//! lights it and fades it out with distance.
//!
//! **A guess**: the game draws the candidates' random numbers from one
//! generator seeded from the clock at start-up (`00aa5230`, a Mersenne
//! twister), so where each blade lands differs every time the game runs.
//! Here the same kind of generator is seeded per spot and grass
//! ([`spot_seed`]), so a spot always comes out the same; the counts and
//! the spread match the game's on average, not blade for blade. The
//! brightness and size are exact: the game seeds those from each blade's
//! position.
