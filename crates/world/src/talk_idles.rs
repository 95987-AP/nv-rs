//! Someone's body while they talk to the player: the idle requests the
//! game makes for the speaker in the dialogue menu.
//!
//! Read from `FalloutNV.exe` 1.4.0.525 (names marked (Xbox PDB) come from
//! the prototype's symbols):
//!
//! - The dialogue menu updates the speaker every frame
//!   (`Actor::UpdateInDialogue`, Xbox PDB, `008a5580`). With a response to
//!   say it stores the response's `bUseEmotion` (actor +0x86, `008a5cf0`)
//!   and calls the say function (Actor vtable +0x284, `008a20d0`) with the
//!   response's emotion, its speaker and listener idles
//!   (`DialogueResponse` +0x18/+0x1c, Xbox PDB) and a last argument of
//!   one. The say sets the speaking emotion (vfuncs +0x2d4, +0x2dc) and,
//!   since that last argument is set, asks for an idle: the response's
//!   speaker idle (request mode 3), else the idle tree (mode 2), even
//!   while another special idle plays (the request's "force" argument).
//! - After that, every frame while the speaker runs their dialogue
//!   package (type 0x1c): once their special idle is done (`004985f0`)
//!   and no request waits (process +0x350, vfunc +0x718), the tree is
//!   asked again (mode 2, not forced).
//! - A request (`008dab40`, process vfunc +0x44) is refused unless the
//!   actor's sit state is 0, 4 or 9 (standing, seated, asleep), and
//!   unless their special idle is done, an idle is named or it is forced.
//!   With no idle named the tree is asked (`00600950`) when no special
//!   idle is starting (`00498f80`).
//! - Leaving the menu (`Actor::EndDialogue`, Xbox PDB, `008b1070`) sets
//!   process flag 0x800 for the speaker in sit state 0, 4 or 9; the flags
//!   update (`008ba600`) carries it out once no special idle is starting:
//!   `008daf20` frees the special idle (`00498910(1,0)`, its blend out).
//!
//! The tree's own answer (the `DialogueIdles` / `TalkToPlayer` branch,
//! `ChairDialogueIdles` for the seated) asks `MenuMode 1009`,
//! `IsTalking`, `GetDialogueEmotion` (`005a4480`: the speaking emotion
//! when `bUseEmotion`, else −1) and `GetRandomPercent`: see
//! [`crate::idles::IdleQuestion`].
