//! Companions' wheel (`CompanionWheelMenu`, class 1075, vtable `01071d0c`
//! in FalloutNV.exe; notes in `docs/COMPANIONS.md`): what the menu reads
//! from the companion and what its buttons do to them.
//!
//! - Using a teammate (the player using them, `005fa330`, `00607990`):
//!   the wheel when they can take orders (`00754d90`: alive and up, and not
//!   about to attack the player); else nothing.
//! - Its four switches read the companion's script variables
//!   (`00754de0`, `008c1740`; -1 for one their script lacks):
//!   `FollowerSwitchAggressive` 1, `IsFollowingLong` 1, `CombatStyleRanged`
//!   1, `Waiting` not 0.
//! - A button said as a topic (`007573d0`: the companion's line for it,
//!   `0061a720`) and done (`007575b0`: the line's begin and end result
//!   scripts run on them at once, `005ac1e0`); the aggressive switch also
//!   sets `FollowerSwitchAggressive` itself (`008c16c0`).
//! - A Stimpak (`00756490`): with one in the player's things (`00576260`),
//!   a companion hurt (health below full: `00893590`, current over base
//!   Health, 1 when the base is 0) or with a crippled limb (a condition,
//!   actor values 25 to 30, at 0) gets the Stimpak's effects when hurt
//!   (`008c1f80`), the player loses one (vtable +0x17C), every condition
//!   (25 to 31, the brain's too) is restored by 1000 (`0088b740`), and they
//!   say their `Regenerating` line (`008d5910(13)`, `007573d0`).
