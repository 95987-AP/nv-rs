//! The Pip-Boy's miscellaneous statistics (`GetPCMiscStat`,
//! `ModPCMiscStat`), by the game's own names and numbers (its table at
//! `01189280`). The game bumps them where things happen (read from its
//! code: 1 on finding a place, 4 on each lock picked, 5 on each terminal
//! hacked, 15 on each skill book read, 12 / 31 on speech checks passed or
//! failed, 23 on sleeping, 13 on a visit's first pocket picked:
//! `world::living`); kills by the player count as people or
//! creatures and in the total (where the game bumps those isn't traced).
