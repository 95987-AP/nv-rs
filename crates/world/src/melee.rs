//! Melee and unarmed fighting: blocking, power attacks, what a swing
//! hits, the unarmed specials and knockdowns, as `FalloutNV.exe` 1.4.0.525
//! does them (`docs/MELEE_UNARMED.md`).
//!
//! **Blocking.** The Aim control (6, "Block" in the INI) with a melee
//! weapon or fists out starts the block (`0093e860` → `00894cc0(1)`): the
//! process's block flag (+0xf0) is set and, for the player, `00894940`
//! plays the weapon's `BlockIdle` group (0xaa) as anim action 7; letting go
//! clears it. Someone is blocking while their anim action is 7
//! (`00894d60`). A hit on someone blocking (`009b5a30`, the hit's damage
//! through armour) adds to their damage threshold when the attacker (or the
//! projectile's shooter) is within their hit cone ([`in_hit_cone`],
//! `009a6ae0`): `fBlockSkillBase` + skill × `fBlockSkillMult`
//! ([`block_threshold`], `006463a0`), the skill Melee Weapons when both
//! have a weapon and the blocker's is a one- or two-handed melee weapon,
//! else Unarmed when the attacker has none or the blocker's is a
//! hand-to-hand weapon, else 0; nothing when blocking with fists against a
//! gun or a projectile. The hit is flagged blocked (`00407e00(1, 1)`) and
//! the player's counter-attack timer (+0xe28) is set to
//! `fCounterAttackTimer`.
//!
//! **Power attacks** (`00948310`, the Attack control): an attack starts on
//! the press; while the control stays held a timer (`011e07b0`) counts the
//! frame's seconds, and past `fPowerAttackDelay` (0.3) a power attack
//! follows ([`power_attack_group`]): `AttackPower` (0x5c) sneaking or with
//! both legs crippled, else by the movement keys `AttackForwardPower`
//! (0x5d), `AttackBackPower` (0x5e), `AttackLeftPower` (0x5f),
//! `AttackRightPower` (0x60), forward first; unarmed perks replace them by
//! the custom power attacks (entry points 61–66), and an unarmed attack
//! within the counter-attack timer with entry point 64 is the `Counter`
//! (0xa8). The power attack's damage is × `fDamagePowerAttackBonus`
//! unless the attacker sneaks (`009b5170`, `00644520`): inside a weapon's
//! damage, after the armour for fists (`world::combat::fists_power_bonus`).
//! Power attacks cost no action points or fatigue (the settings
//! `fActionPointsPowerAttackMult`, `fPowerAttackFatiguePenalty` and the
//! direction bonuses `fDamagePowerAttack…Bonus` are read by nothing), and
//! there's no cooldown besides the hold (`fPowerAttackDelay`).
//!
//! **What a swing hits** ([`find_target`], `009a60e0`, after
//! [`swing_reach`], `008990f0`): someone with a combat target only that
//! one; the player whoever is within reach (the gap between the bodies)
//! and the hit cone ([`Cones`], [`cone_check`]: the player's cone by the
//! attack, `009a6a40`; × 3 up close; dead ones × 2) nearest its middle.
//!
//! **Unarmed specials** ([`unarmed_special_group`], `00893a40`): outside
//! V.A.T.S. an unarmed attack becomes `Attack6` (uppercut) or `Attack7`
//! (cross) by chances from the Unarmed skill; the hit ([`special_of`],
//! `00899200` → `0089a760`) then staggers (uppercut, and the unarmed
//! left and right custom power attacks: a staggered person drops the
//! weapon when the arm holding it is hit) or does × 2.5 limb damage
//! (cross). V.A.T.S.'s Uppercut and Cross play the same groups
//! (`world::vats::attack_group`).
//!
//! **Knockdowns** ([`knockdown_chance`], [`knocks_down`]): the attacker's
//! "Knockdown Chance" perks (Super Slam) on each hit (`0089a760`).
