//! The music manager (`0082fb70`, run once a frame from the main loop),
//! the controllers it updates (`00595600`) and the sets they play
//! (`00597990`: location `00597a60`, dungeon `00598060`, battle
//! `00598550`, incidental `00598890`), over the two [`Decks`].
//!
//! Each frame, in order:
//!
//! 1. (The Pip-Boy radio being on stops everything: no radio here.)
//! 2. While `PlayMusic`'s track (or menu music) plays, nothing else runs.
//! 3. A region battle set already playing goes on until the fight ends.
//! 4. The audio marker holding the player (else the nearest, in 2D,
//!    chosen again about once a second) has its controller updated; if it
//!    plays, that's all.
//! 5. Otherwise the place's acoustic space's region (or an exterior
//!    square's region with incidental music) plays a battle set from its
//!    `RDSB`s in a fight, else its incidental set's phrases when the last
//!    deck is empty; the location and dungeon decks fade out over 1 s.
//!
//! What's guessed here (everything else is read from the code): which
//! actors count as aware of the player (the game's detection isn't run:
//! anyone fighting the player, and anyone alive within the sneak
//! distance), the acoustic space (the cell's own `XCAS`; placed acoustic
//! spaces aren't read), the random numbers (the game's Mersenne twister
//! is shared with everything else, so its picks can't be matched: the
//! rules for them are the game's), and a folder's file order (Windows'
//! listing, taken as sorted by name).
