//! People's gunfire and their next target, read from the game's code
//! (`FalloutNV.exe` 1.4.0.525; names marked (Xbox PDB) come from the Xbox
//! 360 prototype's symbols). Evidence: `docs/NPC_COMBAT.md`.
//!
//! A shot by someone in combat (`00523150`, the weapon's fire, the branch
//! for actors other than the player with a combat controller):
//!
//! - it leaves the actor's fire node (`Actor::GetFireNode`, Xbox PDB, vtable
//!   +0x20c on PC), else the point 0.75 of their height above their feet
//!   (`009a8050` → `009a7fa0`; [`fire_height`]);
//! - it is aimed straight at the point the ranged attack procedure targets
//!   (`CombatController::GetTargetedPoint`, Xbox PDB, `009807f0` → the action
//!   procedure's vtable +0x18): the target's feet raised by a share of its
//!   height chosen by which part of it is in view ([`aim_height`],
//!   `009a8600`/`009a8460`), led by the target's velocity only for
//!   projectiles that aren't hitscan (`009a8df0`);
//! - then turned at random within a cone: the weapon's cone (its min
//!   spread and the ammunition's spread effects, `world::combat::Weapon::
//!   shot`) + the shooter's gun wobble (`008b0dd0` mode 2 →

//!   in degrees, + the process's aim offset (`+0x1d0`, decaying to 0,
//!   `009295c0`; taken as 0 here) ([`npc_cone`]); the turn is uniform in its
//!   angle off the aim and around it ([`deviate`]).
//!
//! The wobble's inputs for people: walking (movement flag 0x100) or
//! running (0x200), sneaking, and aiming down the sights, which the combat
//! AI turns on when the target is farther than `fCombatIronSightsDistance`
//! (512) × the weapon's sight usage (`DNAM` f32 at 124, the weapon's
//! `+0x170`; `008f74c0`, `009d0a30`; [`uses_iron_sights`]).
//!
//! Not read anywhere in the code (the settings inventory lists only their
//! initialisers): the `fGunSpread*` settings and the
//! `fWeaponConditionSpread1–10` table, so a weapon's condition doesn't
//! change its spread; `fAICombat…PriorityMult` and
//! `fCombatRangedStandoffTimer` likewise.
//!
//! After losing a target (killed or given up), the combat controller asks
//! its combat group for the best of the group's targets
//! (`CombatController::RemoveTarget`-like `0097f4d0` →
//! `CombatGroup::GetBestTarget`, Xbox PDB, `00986c60`; [`best_target`]); the
