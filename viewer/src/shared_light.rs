//! The hour's light outdoors (the ambient, the sun's colour and direction,
//! the fog), kept once for every surface instead of in each material.
//!
//! Outdoors the light changes with the clock (`crate::daylight`, a game
//! minute at a time, two real seconds at `TimeScale` 30). Written into
//! each lit, terrain and distant-land material, every change made Bevy
//! upload every material's uniform and build its bind group again: 20 to
//! 30 ms in Goodsprings, a hitch every two seconds. Here the light is a
//! storage buffer every material binds ([`BUFFER`]); its asset never
//! changes after it's made, so the materials' bind groups stay as they
//! are, and a render-world system writes the light into the buffer
//! itself when it changes.
//!
//! The terrain and the distant land are outdoors only and always read it;
//! a lit surface reads it when its `GameLighting::scale.z` is 1, which
//! `crate::daylight` sets on the surfaces it lights (not the menus' 3D
//! pieces, marked [`MenuLit`], which keep their own light).

// The shader-layout derive generates checking functions the compiler
// reports as unused.
