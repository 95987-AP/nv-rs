//! People and creatures noticing and fighting, as the game's combat AI
//! does (`world::combat_ai`, read from its code; this file only measures
//! and moves):
//!
//! - Each actor's detection run (every 0.3 s in combat, staggered up to
//!   5 s more out of it; none farther than 8192 units from the player)
//!   works out its detection value for the player and everyone else
//!   loaded. A value rising above −20 starts a fight where aggression and
//!   factions say so; allies join by their Assistance; the unaggressive run
//!   from those much stronger who'd attack them.
//! - Gunmen keep within their weapon's band, strafing every 2–5 s, and fire
//!   at the game's pace (semi-automatic: after the attack and a random
//!   delay; automatic: 1 s bursts, 1 s pauses), only at a target in sight
//!   within the aim arc. Melee fighters run in, fast-walk the last 64 units,
//!   and after each attack roll attack or hold by their combat style.
//! - A target unseen for 15 s is searched for; unseen for 30 s (never seen)
//!   or 60 s (and more than 4096 units away) it's given up, and they go
//!   back to their packages.
//!
//! Measured here (guesses where the game's way isn't traced): lines of
//! sight are rays through the cell's collision 60 units above the feet;
//! the spot in the band a gunman moves to is on the line to the target,
//! halfway into the band (the game searches the navmesh, `009d5000`); a
//! search walks to where the target was last seen, then to random spots
//! within the smallest search radius every `fCombatSearchAreaUpdateTime`;
//! someone fleeing runs `fCombatFleeNormalDistance` (2048) straight away
//! from the threat until they no longer notice it; paths toward a moving
//! target are made again every half second. Not done: crouching, dodging,
//! cover, blocking (no block animations are played, so the block score is 0
//! as for those without one), suppressive fire, the hit landing at the
//! attack animation's hit key, the reload and equip animations (the reload
//! only waits its time).
//!
//! Shots (`world::npc_aim`, [`resolve_shots`]): each is aimed at the
//! middle of the target's height from 0.75 of the shooter's (the fire
//! node's own place, posed by the animation, isn't used), turned at random
//! within the weapon's cone plus the shooter's gun wobble × 15°
//! (`fNPCMaxGunWobbleAngle`; walking, running and aiming down the sights
//! past 512 × the weapon's sight usage count), and flies as a ray to the
//! first body (its skeleton's capsules; the player's bounds), scripted
//! object or wall within the projectile's range: shots miss and hit
//! bystanders. Someone other than their targets first on the straight
//! line holds the shot (`009a6e90`). Missiles that fly in the game are
//! rays here too.
//!
//! Their targets (`Targets`): everyone they start a fight with or notice
//! rising while fighting and would attack; when the target dies or is
//! given up, the best of the rest (`world::npc_aim::best_target`) is
//! fought next, as the combat group's target choice does. The group's
//! shared targets and detection, and the re-choice whenever the combat
//! planner plans anew (its timer isn't traced), aren't modelled: each
//! fighter keeps its own.
//!
//! People choose what they fight with (`world::npc_combat`): when the fight
//! starts and every 5 s, the best weapon of each kind they carry with
//! ammunition, guns rated out of play when they don't reach, the cheapest
//! attack kind, fists included; clips empty and are reloaded, and only
//! weapons flagged "NPCs use ammo" (dynamite) or a teammate's use rounds
//! up. Their script's `OnStartCombat` runs once their target is detected.
//!
//! Someone holding a grenade or dynamite keeps out of its blast (the band's
//! minimum is at least its radius) and throws it at the target's pace of
//! fire (`explosives` works out the arc); the grenade procedure's own
//! timing (`009cafe0`) isn't traced further.
